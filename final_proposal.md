Continuing from my project two, I am going to look at the chamge in zomomg and how it relates (if at all) to the spatial distribution of different races.  I plan on using the same data from Project two im addition to census demographic data.  [Vital Signs Archive](https://bniajfi.org/vital_signs/archives/).  First I plan to use a SQL statement to spatial join different year demographics data.  Than, I will use python to run analysis on the demographics data and land use change data to figure out the amount of change in each census tract.  I will compare this to the dominant race in that tract. I can use GeoDa to run a cluster analysis on the amount of chamge for each tract and use significance filters to determine if the data shows anything of importance. 

I choose this, because it ties in with my project 2 and expands on it.  This will be more involved than the labs, because it involves multiple tools and programs to complete.  Unlike the GeoDa lab I will be uskng my own data that I created and not
