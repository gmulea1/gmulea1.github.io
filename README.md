# Zoning in Baltimore City

In this project, I am analyzing the distribution of zones versus the distance from the Patapsco River.

In order to achieve this analysis I used the real_property dataset from the Baltimore City Open Data Source.  
First I had to sort and reclassify the zoning column to fit the categories of Commercial, Residential, Industrial, Open Space, Office, Education, Transit, Historic, and Other.  I used a case - when function within the field calculator.
